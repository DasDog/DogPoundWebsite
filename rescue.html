            <p>Breed: Siberian Husky</p>
            <p>Gender: Male</p>
            <p>Age: Unknown. Guessed to be 5.</p>
            <p>Hobbies: Playing in the snow and watching over his family.</p>
            <p>Backstory: We found Blue in the middle of a snow storm in the middle of the winter wandering the streets alone. He had no tags or any way to identify where his home was so we took him in. Blue is named after the color of his eyes because that is all we could see through the snowstorm.</p>
